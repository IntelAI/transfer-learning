# Transfer Learning for TensorFlow Image Classification using the TLK API

This notebook demonstrates how to use the TLK API to do transfer learning for
image classification using TensorFlow.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies
1. Get the model
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Transfer learning
1. Evaluate
1. Predict
1. Export

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [TensorFlow notebook environment](/notebooks#tensorflow-environment).
