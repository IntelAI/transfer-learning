# Transfer Learning for PyTorch Image Classification using the IntelÂ® Transfer Learning Tool API

This notebook demonstrates how to use the TLT API to do transfer learning for
image classification using PyTorch.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Import dependencies
1. Get the model
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Transfer learning
1. Evaluate
1. Predict
1. Export

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [PyTorch notebook environment](/notebooks#pytorch-environment).
