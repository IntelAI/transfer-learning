# Text Classifier fine tuning with TensorFlow

This notebook demonstrates fine tuning using various [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) models
from [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev) using IntelÂ® Optimization for TensorFlow for binary text classification.

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Install dependencies and setup parameters
1. Prepare the dataset using either a TF dataset or your own images
1. Predict using the original model
1. Transfer learning
1. Evaluate the model
1. Export the saved model

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [TensorFlow notebook environment](/notebooks#tensorflow-environment).
