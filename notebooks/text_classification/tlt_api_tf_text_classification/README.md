# Text Classifier fine tuning with TensorFlow and the IntelÂ® Transfer Learning Tool API

This notebook demonstrates how to use the TLT API to do fine tuning for
text classification using various [BERT](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805) models
from [TF Hub](https://tfhub.dev).

The notebook performs the following steps:
1. Install dependencies and setup parameters
1. Get the model
1. Get the dataset
1. Prepare the dataset
1. Fine tuning
1. Evaluate
1. Predict
1. Export the saved model

## Running the notebook

To run the notebook, follow the instructions to setup the [TensorFlow notebook environment](/notebooks/setup.md#tensorflow-environment).
