## Installation 
### Hardware Requirements

| Recommended Hardware         | Precision  |
| ---------------------------- | ---------- |
| Intel® 4th Gen Xeon® Scalable Performance processors | BF16 |
| Intel® 1st, 2nd, 3rd, and 4th Gen Xeon® Scalable Performance processors | FP32 |

### Software Requirements
* Linux* system (validated on Ubuntu* 20.04/22.04 LTS)
* Python3* (3.8, 3.9, or 3.10), Pip and Conda/Virtualenv
* Install required packages with `apt-get install build-essential python3-dev libgl1 libglib2.0-0`
* git (only required for the "Developer Installation")

### Create and activate a Python3 virtual environment
We encourage you to use a python virtual environment (virtualenv or conda) for consistent package management.
There are two ways to do this:

a. Using `virtualenv`:
   ```
   virtualenv -p python3 tlt_dev_venv
   source tlt_dev_venv/bin/activate
   ```

b. Or `conda`:
   ```
   conda create --name tlt_dev_venv python=3.9
   conda activate tlt_dev_venv
   ```

### Basic Installation
```
pip install intel-transfer-learning-tool
```

### Developer Installation
Use these instructions to install the Intel® Transfer Learning Tool using a clone of the
GitHub repository. This can be done instead of the basic pip install, if you plan
on making code changes.

1. Clone this repo and navigate to the repo directory:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/IntelAI/transfer-learning.git

   cd transfer-learning
   ```

2. Install the Intel Transfer Learning Tool by either:

   a. Building and installing the wheel:
      ```
      python setup.py bdist_wheel
      pip install dist/intel_transfer_learning_tool-0.4.0-py3-none-any.whl
      ```

   b. Or, do an editable install to avoid having to rebuild and install after each code change:
      ```
      pip install --editable .
      ```

### Additional Feature-Specific Steps:
 1. For TensorFlow text classification, this tensorflow-text Python library is also required:
    ```
    pip install tensorflow-text==2.11.0
    ```

 1. For distributed/multinode training, follow these additional [distributed training instructions](https://github.com/IntelAI/transfer-learning-tool/tree/main/tlt/distributed).

### Verify Installation

Verify that your installation was successful by using the following
command, which displays help information about the Intel Transfer Learning Tool:
```
