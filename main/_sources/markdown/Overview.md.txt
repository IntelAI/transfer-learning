## Overview

The Intel速 Transfer Learning Tool offers both a low-code API and a no-code CLI for training AI models with TensorFlow*
and PyTorch*.

Features:
* PyTorch and TensorFlow support
* Over 100 image classification and text classification models from Torchvision, TensorFlow datasets, and Hugging Face
* Automatically create a trainable classification layer customized for your dataset
* Bring your own dataset or get started quickly with built-in datasets
* Dataset scaling, cropping, batching, and splitting
* APIs for prediction, evaluation, and benchmarking
* Export model for deployment or resume training from checkpoints

Intel Optimizations:
* Boost performance with Intel速 Optimization for TensorFlow and Intel速 Extension for PyTorch
* Quantize to INT8 to reduce model size and speed up inference using Intel速 Neural Compressor
* Optimize model for FP32 inference using Intel Neural Compressor
* Reduce training time with auto-mixed precision for select hardware platforms
* Further reduce training time with multinode training for PyTorch
