## How it Works
Run simple CLI commands at a bash prompt or make API calls in a Python* script to:

1. Download public pretrained models, replace the classification layer, and train them using your own dataset
2. Minimize training time with Intel-optimized frameworks and low-precision features from Intel Neural Compressor
3. Export a saved model optimized for inference on Intel CPUs
